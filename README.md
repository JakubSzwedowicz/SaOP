Project contains applications, algorithms and sollutions to problems described below


# Projects
1. List 1
**D1** - Determine affiliation of point P(x, y), knowing it's coordinates, ro colored zones of plane or to the background.

**D2** - Print three given numbers A, B and C  in ascending order.

**D3** - Sort three given numbers A, B and C in acending order. What is the difference between this and previous (D2) task?

**D4** - Check if it's possible to build a triangle from three line segments, if so then which one:
a) equilateral, isosceles, scalene?
b) acute, right, obtuse?

**D5** - Check if given point P(x, y) lays on the triangle described with three coordinates A, B and C.

**D6** - Today is DD/MM/RR. What was the date yesterday? which one is going to be tomorrow?

2. List 2
**I1** - Having series of 'n' real numbers, count:
	a) sum of all the numbers,
	b) arithmetic mean of all positive numbers,
	c) arithmetic mean of all the numbers directly following the positive ones.

**I2** - Count the sum of digits of the natural number K. Use division remainder %.

**I3** - How many significant figures does the natural number K have?

**I4** - What is the biggest digit of a natural number K?

**I5** - Check if natural number K is prime.

**I6** - Find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of natural numbers M and N. 

**I7** - Use [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)(division remainder version) for the I6 task.

**I8** - Use [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)(without division remainder) again for the I6 task.

**I9** - Count the 'X' to the power of 'K' ('K' - natural number). Do your best to minimize muliplications.

**I10** - Using Maclaurin series (special case of [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series)) count approximate values of e^x, sin(x) and cos(x) with a given precision.
